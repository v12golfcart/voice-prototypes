# UXR Prototype: AI-Powered Interview Agents

A showcase demonstrating how intelligent agents can revolutionize user experience research through contextual, real-time interviews across different industries and use cases.

## 🎯 Project Vision

This project explores the potential of AI agents to conduct sophisticated user interviews that capture insights at the moment of need, rather than relying on traditional post-hoc research methods. We demonstrate three distinct wedges where AI-powered interviews can transform how organizations gather and act on user feedback.

## 🚀 Three Prototype Experiences

### 1. **Instant Insight Box** 
*Target: Product Teams & SaaS Companies*

**User Flow:**
- After a feature release, users see a subtle prompt: "Want to help improve this feature?"
- Clicking opens a 1-minute voice/text interaction
- AI asks contextual questions based on product state and user actions
- Follow-ups are dynamically generated based on product context and logs

**Value Proposition:**
- Captures high-signal usability breakdowns at the moment of friction
- Automatically clusters and prioritizes issues across users
- Feeds into ticketing systems with context-rich summaries

**Example Output:**
> "15 users failed to invite teammates via the new share flow. Most expected the invite link to copy automatically after clicking. Suggest tooltip or auto-copy confirmation."

### 2. **Smart Follow-Up Concierge** 
*Target: CPG Companies & E-commerce*

**User Flow:**
- Day 1 post-purchase: SMS/web prompt for quick feedback
- Incentivized participation ($10 refund eligibility)
- AI conducts natural conversation about product experience
- Can provide real-time support or escalate to human agents

**Value Proposition:**
- Blends post-purchase support, feedback collection, and upsell timing
- Detects intent signals (frustration, churn, delight)
- Routes to appropriate next actions automatically

**Example Output:**
> "20% of customers said the skincare bottle leaks when tilted. Add 'travel-safe' messaging or redesign cap."

### 3. **On-Demand Expert Pulse** 
*Target: Investors & Product Builders*

**User Flow:**
- Investor submits research question (e.g., "How are CFOs handling AI spend?")
- AI identifies and interviews relevant experts asynchronously
- Experts can also monetize their insights through on-demand bookings
- Synthesized findings delivered as structured reports

**Value Proposition:**
- Expert network with zero scheduling friction
- Scales to dozens of niche questions weekly
- Transforms tacit market knowledge into searchable insights

**Example Output:**
> "Structured memo: '2024 AI Spend Patterns Among Series B CFOs' - Budget allocation trends, ROI metrics, and emerging concerns"

## 🛠 Technical Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15.3 with React 19
- **Language:** TypeScript for type safety
- **Voice:** 11Labs integration (planned)

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Conversational First:** Natural dialogue flows that feel human
- **Context-Aware:** Leverage available data to ask better questions
- **Moment-Appropriate:** Capture feedback when users are most engaged
- **Action-Oriented:** Generate insights that directly inform decisions

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

## 🎯 Prototype Goals

1. **Demonstrate Feasibility:** Show that AI can conduct meaningful user interviews
2. **Showcase Versatility:** Prove the concept works across different industries
3. **Inspire Adoption:** Provide tangible examples for product teams and researchers
4. **Validate Approach:** Gather feedback on the interview agent concept

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Real-time voice interactions with natural conversation flow
- Integration with popular product analytics tools
- Advanced sentiment analysis and intent detection
- Multi-language support for global research
- API for embedding agents into existing products

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **Engagement:** Time spent in interview sessions
- **Quality:** Depth and actionability of generated insights
- **Adoption:** Interest from product teams and researchers
- **Feedback:** User satisfaction with the interview experience
